## Summary

Matching questions today resolve every candidate lookup with a **live Overpass
query** (`src/features/questions/matching/osmMatching.ts:5`). This requires network,
is rate-limited, times out, and does not work offline. This epic makes the same
`(category, lat, lon, radius)` lookups resolvable from **on-device bundled OSM POI
data**, with Overpass kept as the online fallback and refresh path.

The work is deliberately phased:

- **Phase 1 (MVP):** Bundle the Kantō POI set into the app binary and serve matching
  queries locally when the play area is inside Kantō. Tasks 01–06.
- **Phase 2 (scale):** On-demand downloadable region packs for the rest of Japan and,
  eventually, worldwide. Task 07.

## Motivation

A measured extraction of the **exact tag set the matching engine queries** (not the
broad sets in `SIZES.md`) against the cached `kanto-latest.osm.pbf` shows the data is
small enough to bundle directly:

| Scope                              | Tagged features | Named (engine keeps) | Raw JSON |     gzip -9 | Per-feature gz |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------: | -------------------: | -------: | ----------: | -------------: |
| Curated category set, all of Kantō |          77,886 |           **58,479** |  2.68 MB | **0.93 MB** |        ~16.6 B |

`SIZES.md`'s "Useful" 12.5 MB figure measures _all named amenity/shop/tourism/…_. The
engine only queries **~14 specific `key=value` combos** (see
[`src/features/questions/matching/matchingCategories.ts`](../../../src/features/questions/matching/matchingCategories.ts)),
so the real payload is ~13× smaller. Reproduce with the command in the
[Appendix](#appendix-reproducing-the-measurement).

Feasibility verdict:

| Target                  | gzip (measured/est.) | Verdict                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------------: | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Kantō                   |             ~0.93 MB | Bundle directly in the app. (Phase 1)             |
| All Japan (~10 regions) |              ~2–3 MB | Bundle directly. (Phase 1 extension)              |
| Worldwide               |         ~50–150 MB\* | On-demand region packs, not one bundle. (Phase 2) |

\* Worldwide scales the measured ~16.6 B/feature by an order-of-magnitude estimate of
3–8 M named features in these categories globally. The conclusion (region packs) holds
even if the estimate is off by 2×.

## Goals

- Resolve matching `(category, lat, lon, radius)` lookups offline for bundled regions.
- Keep Overpass as the fallback for un-bundled regions and as the staleness-refresh path.
- Change **one seam** in the matching data layer; leave ranking, the cell-grid cache,
  Voronoi rendering, and the consumer screen untouched.
- Make extraction (pipeline) and querying (runtime) share **one source of truth** for the
  category → OSM tag mapping so they cannot drift.
- Ship the data with correct ODbL attribution.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing Overpass entirely. It remains the source for un-bundled regions, the
  `transit-line` category (handled by the ODPT/transit feature, not OSM tags), and
  staleness revalidation.
- Bundling admin-division boundaries (`admin-1st`…`admin-4th`). Those are
  `boundary=administrative` **relations** served by the separate Geofabrik boundary
  pipeline; in Phase 1 they fall through to Overpass. See
  [Category set](#category-set).
- Migrating the OSM matching cache to TanStack Query. Per
  [`../react-query-cache-migration.md`](../react-query-cache-migration.md) it stays
  bespoke because of its spatial-containment logic. This epic plugs into that bespoke
  cache, it does not replace it.
- Vector map tiles / basemap offline support. Out of scope; this is POI data only.
- A spatial index library. Linear scan is sufficient at these counts (see
  [Key decisions](#key-decisions)); an index is a future optimization, not a dependency.

## Current data flow

```
OsmMatchingQuestionDetailScreen.performSearch()
  └─ findMatchingFeaturesWithCellCache(category, center, opts)   ← osmMatchingCache.ts
       ├─ cellsForSearch() → memory LRU → AsyncStorage (per cell)
       └─ on miss: fetchAndParseOverpassBboxFeatures(category, s,w,n,e)  ← osmMatching.ts
            └─ fetch(OVERPASS_API) → parseOverpassElements()  (drops unnamed)
                 → OsmFeature[]  →  rankMatchingFeatures() (haversine sort)
```

The active path is the **cell cache** (`findMatchingFeaturesWithCellCache`,
`osmMatchingCache.ts:828`). The single network dependency is
`fetchAndParseOverpassBboxFeatures` (`osmMatching.ts:192`), called from
`fetchAndStoreCell` and `cellRevalidateInBackground`.

## Target data flow

```
findMatchingFeaturesWithCellCache(...)                          ← UNCHANGED
  └─ fetchAndStoreCell / cellRevalidateInBackground
       └─ resolveBboxFeatures(category, bbox, signal)           ← NEW SEAM (task 04)
            ├─ if bundled region covers bbox → localBboxFeatures()   (in-memory scan)
            └─ else                          → fetchAndParseOverpassBboxFeatures()
```

The seam is a single function the cache calls instead of Overpass directly. Everything
above it (cell math, LRU, AsyncStorage, ranking, the screen) is unchanged. A cell served
locally is stamped `fetchedAt = bundle.generatedAt`, so when the device is online and the
data ages past `MATCHING_CACHE_TTL_MS` (90d) the existing stale-while-revalidate logic
refreshes it from Overpass for free.

## Key decisions

| Decision                         | Choice                                                                                                | Why                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-device datatype**           | Columnar JSON per region (parallel `lon[]`, `lat[]`, `name[]`, `osmId[]`, `osmType[]` arrays)         | No repeated object keys → smaller; cache-friendly; trivially maps to typed arrays later. `tags` is dropped — verified unused downstream (only the parse stage reads it).                        |
| **Spatial query**                | Linear haversine scan within a category's arrays                                                      | Per-category counts are small (largest is `park` ~30k; most <2k). A full scan is sub-millisecond. Zero new deps. An index (`kdbush`) is a future optimization.                                  |
| **Integration seam**             | `resolveBboxFeatures` behind the cell cache                                                           | One function swap. Preserves all existing cache, ranking, and rendering behavior; gives graceful per-cell fallback at region edges.                                                             |
| **Coverage check**               | Query bbox ⊆ a single bundled region bbox → local; else Overpass                                      | Simple and correct-by-overestimate. Multi-region merge is a documented future refinement.                                                                                                       |
| **Bundling mechanism (Phase 1)** | One JSON file per region, loaded **lazily** via a literal `require()` switch                          | Metro bundles `.json` natively (precedent: `assets/default-zones/tokyo.json`, 175 KB). Lazy `require` defers the ~2.7 MB parse until the first matching query in a covered region. No new deps. |
| **Bundling mechanism (Phase 2)** | `.json.gz` downloaded to the document dir, inflated with `fflate`, persisted                          | Network payload must be compressed; needs `expo-file-system`. Deferred to task 07 so Phase 1 ships with zero new dependencies.                                                                  |
| **Source of truth**              | TS selector registry (`matchingSelectors.ts`), emitted to JSON for the pipeline, guarded by `--check` | Prevents extraction/query drift. Mirrors the existing `data:default-zones` + `test:data:default-zones --check` pattern.                                                                         |
| **Freshness**                    | Local cells stamped with `bundle.generatedAt`                                                         | Reuses the existing 90-day TTL + SWR to auto-refresh from Overpass when online. No new refresh machinery in Phase 1.                                                                            |

## Category set

The registry (task 01) is the authority. Phase 1 bundles the **14 point-POI categories**;
two groups are intentionally excluded.

**Bundled (point POIs, `out center` collapses areas to a centroid):**

| Category              | OSM selector                                | Kantō named (approx.) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------: |
| `park`                | `leisure=park`                              |                  ~30k |
| `hospital`            | `amenity=hospital`                          |                 ~3.5k |
| `station-name-length` | `railway=station` (covers `station=subway`) |                 ~2.2k |
| `museum`              | `tourism=museum`                            |                 ~1.9k |
| `golf-course`         | `leisure=golf_course`                       |                 ~1.9k |
| `landmark`            | `tourism=attraction`                        |                 ~1.7k |
| `mountain`            | `natural=peak`                              |                 ~1.6k |
| `library`             | `amenity=library`                           |                 ~1.5k |
| `movie-theater`       | `amenity=cinema`                            |                 ~0.2k |
| `amusement-park`      | `tourism=theme_park`                        |                ~0.17k |
| `zoo`                 | `tourism=zoo`                               |                ~0.15k |
| `commercial-airport`  | `aeroway=aerodrome`                         |                ~0.06k |
| `aquarium`            | `tourism=aquarium`                          |                ~0.06k |
| `foreign-consulate`   | `diplomatic=consulate`                      |          rare (Tokyo) |

**Excluded — Overpass fallback in Phase 1:**

- `admin-1st`…`admin-4th` — `boundary=administrative` **relations**. Few features, better
  derived from the boundary pipeline's polygons later (Phase 1.5, noted in task 02).
- `transit-line` — not OSM-tag based (`osmQueryTags: ""`); handled by the transit feature.

## Risks & mitigations

| Risk                                                           | Mitigation                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Extraction tags drift from runtime query tags → silent gaps    | Single registry (task 01) + `--check` CI guard.                                                                                                        |
| Node-only extraction misses area POIs (parks, golf, hospitals) | Pipeline extracts node **+ way + relation**, reduces to centroid (task 02). This is why the measured count is 58k, not the report's node-only framing. |
| Bundled JSON inflates startup time / memory                    | Lazy `require` defers parse to first matching query; one region ~2.7 MB parsed. Re-evaluate with the perf harness (`pnpm perf:test`).                  |
| Bundle goes stale between app releases                         | `generatedAt` stamp + 90-day SWR refresh from Overpass when online.                                                                                    |
| Region-edge play areas straddle the bundle bbox                | Per-cell fallback (each uncovered cell hits Overpass). Multi-region merge is a future refinement.                                                      |
| App-store size growth as regions are added                     | Phase 2 moves additional regions to on-demand downloads (task 07); keep the in-binary bundle to Kantō (or a small default set).                        |
| ODbL share-alike obligations                                   | Attribution shipped in data + surfaced in-app (task 06); `NOTICE.md` already present.                                                                  |

## Open questions

1. **Default in-binary region(s):** Kantō only, or Kantō + Kansai? Affects binary size
   (~0.9 MB vs ~2 MB) vs. how many users get instant offline. Recommend Kantō-only for
   Phase 1; decide before task 02 wiring.
2. **Coordinate precision:** 6 decimals (~0.1 m) is specified; confirm acceptable for
   centroid-based ranking (it is — ranking is by relative distance).
3. **Per-category files vs one region file:** Phase 1 uses one region file (simpler Metro
   wiring). Revisit per-category sharding if a single region file grows past ~5 MB.
